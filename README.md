# Project Ruby Scarab

Project Ruby Scarab is a wearable hearing-assistive device designed to give haptic feedback when someone says a chosen phrase-- you can feel someone calling your name.
These are the control files for the arduino-based hardware stack.

'Borrows' heavily from the voice control library's example files.
